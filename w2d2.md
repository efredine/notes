# JavaScript
Apparently the use of i++ is frowned upon.  Instead, use i += 1.  (Something to do with a problem AirBnB found...).

## IIFE
```javascript
(function (args…) { })()
```
This is what’s known as a closure (and, more specifically, an “Immediately Invoked Function Expression” or IIFE).

## Precedence
[Operator precedence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)
Ternerary operator has quite low precedence, see what happens if you remove the brackets in this!
```javascript
a + (isNaN(b) ? 0 : b)
```

## Numbers
Number vs. parseInt -- Number parses for any type of valid number (floats, ints, etc), need to use parseInt if you just want an int!

```javascript
var a = Number('cats'); // NaN
'a' + a; // 'aNaN'
```
String is the most powerful coercion!  And so, some weird things happen.

## Falsey
```javascript
// All of the following are inherently falsey:

false
// False is False. Makes sense, right?

0
// 0 is the only falsey Number

""
// an empty string is falsey

null
// a null, or empty value, is falsey.

undefined
// an object that has not been defined is considered falsey.

NaN
// Not a Number. You'll learn more about NaN as we go on.
```

## NaN
Don't use comparisons with NaN!

From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN):

#### Testing against NaN
NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==) to any other value -- including to another NaN value.  Use Number.isNaN() or isNaN() to most clearldetermine whether a value is NaN.  Or perform a self-comparison: NaN, and only NaN, will compare unequal to itself.

## Node Debuggers
[Three Debugger Options for Node](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/09/25/debug-node-js/)
Step - steps into
Next - runs the next line of code to completion, so executes an entire function
Out - step out of a function

# Coding Style
- open brackets on the same line
- indent long lines 2 levels
