#Node
Upgraded node using nvm (Node Version Manager) -- apparently we're on version 7 of node now.

#Node Modules
Interesting test: run node with a single line of code:
```javascript
throw new Error("Hello");
```
Running this gives:
```bash
vagrant [lecture-sandbox]> node throws-error.js
/vagrant/workfiles/w1/w1d5/lecture-sandbox/throws-error.js:1
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { throw new Error("Well Hello.");
                                                              ^

Error: Well Hello.
    at Object.<anonymous> (/vagrant/workfiles/w1/w1d5/lecture-sandbox/throws-error.js:1:69)
    at Module._compile (module.js:413:34)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:422:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:357:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:314:12)
    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:447:10)
    at startup (node.js:146:18)
    at node.js:404:3
```

Note that __filename and __dirname *may* be the same as the argv parameters, but only
if this is the file being run.  Otherwise, they may be different.

module has a bunch of interesting properties.

exports appears as both a parameter to the function and a property of the modules object.

In both cases, it points to the same object (i.e. it is the same object not two different
empty objects).

```javascript
console.log(exports === module.exports); \\ true
```
require is a function we can call to get other modules.  require will only run each module once.
If you call it again, you get the result from the previous invocation.

#NPM
Always run the scripts in the root of the project!

To 're-inflate' a node module from it's package.json.
```bash
npm install
```

#Testing
Chai Assertion Library has a bunch of convenience methods for assertions (provides a wrapper for assert).

The suggested approach is to use Mocha in conjunction with Chai.

[Chai Styles](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/)

The expect style seems most elegant.  The should style seems supsect because it needs to modify the objects
being tested, which just seems like a bad idea.

#JSDoc
Review - and see how to auto-generate in sublime.

#Javascript Formatting
Use a linter.
Use either the AirBnB or Google style guides for Javascript.
Can use an editor config (on a per project basis) to enforce styling.
IIFE's have sort of fallen out of favour because they aren't really necessary.
[Configuring esLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)


## Linting in sublime
[Article on sublime linting](http://jonathancreamer.com/setup-eslint-with-es6-in-sublime-text/)

From David...
## Step 1

Install the ESLint program globally using NPM.

```
npm install -g eslint
```

## Step 2

Download the Lighthouse Labs ESLint configuration to your user home directory.

```
wget -O ~/.eslintrc.js https://gist.githubusercontent.com/davidvandusen/efaf6f6d735e84378c89d2bd9ba67596/raw/f850ad095a23f584bc54c4561323a54c92d5218f/.eslintrc.js
```

## To lint your files

Run ESLint to see what needs to be fixed in your file. For example:

```
eslint myFile.js
```

The output will tell you what needs to change for the file to be lint-free.
