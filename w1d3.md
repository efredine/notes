# Objects
LSD :: Logic Syntax Data
Every bug can be explained by one or more of these.
Variables are simply labels (for objects).

Object.assign is used to coalesce objects.  It is used to create mix-ins.

# Different kinds of objects
You can create a literal object with both data and methods.  This is (by definition) a singleton.

You can add the methods either as part of the literal object defintion or by assigning properties to it.

```javascript
var o = {data: 1, f: function() {return 1;} };
o.f2 = function() {return 2;};
```

It does not have a prototype property!  Of course, it still has a prototype.

Remember: only Function objects have a prototype property that can be accessed.
