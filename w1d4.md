# Functions
You can name anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are used once and passed in as a parameter).
This can be useful if you need the additional debugging information.
However, it's also possible to just use the line number, so this may not be necessary.

# Closures
[Closures on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
Has interesting information on using closures within loops - it's easy to get this wrong.  I've
already managed to stumble across this a few times.

Using higher-order functions is another way to avoid this problem quite elegantly.

The MDN article also has some useful information on performance considerations.  Essentially: don't
create closures unless you really need them!  Normally, it's better to assign methods to the
prototype of a class rather than declaring them within the constructor function.
