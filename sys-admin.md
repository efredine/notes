#Home brew
Had some errors, so needed to update and repair things.  Apparently, due to latest os upgrade changing permissions
on usr/local.

#Node
Setting up the development environment using this recipe:

I uninstalled node using the incantation in the linked stack overflow article.

It order to install and build NVM I had to install the X-code command line tools.

## eslint
Install using [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/efredine/6407c892816c282604a8e1f4f5b2d1e0) using [this profile](https://gist.github.com/efredine/2f63f1d3f79e88e733860343685162b0)
Then [set-up the linter in sublime](http://jonathancreamer.com/setup-eslint-with-es6-in-sublime-text/).
